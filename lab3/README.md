# Lab 3 code

This code are meant to get you started on solving lab 3.

Note that this is not a proper Eclipse project. Since there are several IDEs being used,
it is probably better to have you bring in this code into a project you create in your
IDE of choice. This actually includes Emacs or any other programming editor.

Project structure, as given:
```
   courseinfo/
      CourseInfo.java		Main program
      BinarySearchTree.java	Datastructure class
```
Here `courseinfo` is a package.

You can compile and run the project on the command line:
```
   javac courseinfo/*.java
   java courseinfo.CourseInfo
```
